# hybrid Rocket flight system 

This is a top-to-bottom architecture to launch and test a hybrid air cannon and solid rocket design. I wanted to build this project for many years, but I never had enough money to make it happen. The introduction of the Blueprint Project gave me a reason to get started. I am excited to finally be able to build the thing I have been thinking about for many years now. This project consists of the rocket, the flight computer, and the ground station. Over the past couple of months, I have designed and iterated on the rocket design, as well as designed the PCB to be manufactured for the rocket and ground station.
